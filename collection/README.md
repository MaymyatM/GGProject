there might be some libraries you will have to install based on what you have and do not have.

To run the model, there are 2 options.

OPTION1

which is running test2.py file directly. But then, there will be no heading as some adjustments were done to heading with sidebar configuaration. 

OPTION2
streamlit run page1.py
which will run side menu configuration, that has about us page and the page from test2.
